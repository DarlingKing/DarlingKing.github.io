# Project Description
## The history of Small World and our aims
“Six degrees of separation is the idea that all people are six or fewer social connections away from each other.” This concept was first introduced by Frigyes Karinthy in a short story. The story is about a group of friends playing a game where the goal is to connect any person in the world to themselves by a chain of five others. 

In the Small-world experiment in the 1960s Stanley Milgram and other researchers examined that the average path length of social networks of people in the United States were around 6. However, the experiment had some flaws as it was not completely randomized and idealized.

It was not until 1998 that Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz published the first network model on the small world phenomenon. And this mathematical model has since been applied in a wide range of different areas.

Today, it is easier to test the model due to the rise of social networks and by testing their datasets. Thus, the goal of this project is to validate and visualise the six degrees of separation using Twitter datasets in two dimensions:

    1. Randomly sample 5 000 and 10 000 users without considering common tags.
    2. Randomly sample 200 users under the top 5 mentioned tags in the dataset.
